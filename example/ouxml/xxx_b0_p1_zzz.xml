        <Paragraph>Writing software guides to support educational modules adds authoring, editing and testing overheads to module production. If multiple modules use similar environments or software applications, reusing generic or customisable materials provides a way or reducing those overheads.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>This informal report describes the production route for a customisable software guide to support the use of virtual computing environments (VCEs) across several modules.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>The VCEs are accessed as a remotely hosted environment provided by the Open University <i>Compute Home</i> service, or as a locally run Docker container. <i>The same Docker image should ideally be used to support both the hosted and locally run environment.</i></Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>A common production route for the software guides required for three separate modules was explored:</Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>In addition, the work demonstrated a markdown-based authoring route with an automated conversion process capable of producing output assets in various formats (OU-XML (for use in OU production workflows: VLE rendering, PDF creation); HTML book format; simple PDF preview). The use of several tools to support quality processes (markdown linting, spellchecking, OU-XML validation) were also explored.</Paragraph>

        <Title>2 Markdown authoring route</Title>
        <Paragraph>The reusable content workflow is based on a markdown authoring route.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>Markdown is a simple text based markup language that can be edited in simple text editor. Markdown is typically rendered or previewed as rendered HTML. Markdown editors that support WYSIWYG user interfaces are also available. Various flavours of markdown are available that extend the core markdown language with more expressive semantics.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>A variety of publishing tools and frameworks are available that can render markdown source documents to a wide range of output document formats, including HTML, PDF, ebook and XML formats.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>As well as rendering rich text, markdown publishing extensions can also be used to render diagrams. For example, flowcharts can be rendered from simple text-based <ComputerCode>Mermaid.js</ComputerCode> scripts.</Paragraph>

    <Session id="authoring-reusable-content">
        <Title>3 Authoring reusable content</Title>
        <Paragraph>To start the authoring process, a legacy software guide available as an OU-XML structured content document was rendered to simple markdown.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>Sphinx style configration and table of contents scripts were created to so that the content could be previewed in an HTML book style format, or rendered back to OU-XML.</Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>Several features of Sphinx style publishing that support extensibility and reuse were adopted that allowed us to trade-off purely generic content, customisable content, and bespoke content for each module.</Paragraph>
        <InternalSection id="table-of-contents-conifiguration-files">
            <Heading>Table of Contents Conifiguration Files</Heading>
            <Paragraph>From a set of content files, one of the easist ways of defining which content files are to be used to generate a particular output document is to specify the files that are to be included via a table of contents file.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In current production workflows, it would not be unusual for each module team author to their own software guide. In a markdown workflow, this might include each module team authoring several separate markdown documents, many of which may  duplicate similar instructional intent, and then create their own table of contents files to use their authored documents.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>One obvious way of reusing content across several modules would be for each module to use exactly the same guide, where the same table of contents file pulls from the same source documents.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>Partial customisation might be supported by each module team writing their own introduction, for example, but reusing all the other sections of the guide.  The output document is then defined using a module specific table of contents file that pulls in the module specific content (for example, from the file <ComputerCode>introduction-XY123.md</ComputerCode>) as well as a the generic reusable content files.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>When writing this sort of content, we must try to avoid making any references to a particular module. Where references to a module code are required, one possible approach is to use a generic code (for example <ComputerCode>XY123</ComputerCode>, or <ComputerCode>XXNNN</ComputerCode>) and then tell a student to use apply their particular module code in place of the generic code.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>For example, two modules might reuse content from a set of common files, as well as featuring module specific content, using the following table of cotnents files:</Paragraph>
            <ProgramListing><Paragraph>format: jb-book</Paragraph><Paragraph>root: g-vce_cribsheet</Paragraph><Paragraph>chapters:</Paragraph><Paragraph>  - file: g-introduction-m348</Paragraph><Paragraph>  - file: g-compute_home</Paragraph><Paragraph>  - file: g-local_vce_quickstart</Paragraph></ProgramListing>

        <InternalSection id="transcluding-embedding-content">
            <Heading>Transcluding / Embedding content</Heading>
            <Paragraph>One of the nice features of the Sphinx publishing workflow is that content files can import content from other content files. This allows us to define “partial” files that might include the content of just a single paragraph, for example.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>A module specific file can then be defined that includes module specific text (either imported from a partial content file or explicitly provided inline within the file) as well as generic text imported from a reusable partial content file.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>For example, the following markdown fragment shows how we might customise a module specific introduction file by first loading in generic content from a reusable file, and then appending some module specific content.</Paragraph>
            <ProgramListing><Paragraph>```{include} ./g-introduction-core.md</Paragraph><Paragraph></Paragraph><Paragraph>Finally, we have a conclusion paragraph that speaks to a particular module.</Paragraph></ProgramListing>
        </InternalSection>
        <InternalSection id="parameterised-customisable-content">
            <Heading>Parameterised Customisable Content</Heading>
            <Paragraph>In many cases, whilst the content is predomninantly reusable, there may be a requirement to customise it for use in particular module by referring to the module code or module name.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>In this case, rather than generate a custom file for each module, we can simply parameterise the module code, module name, etc., and then define a module configration file that sets a genric module name placeholder label, for example, to a required module name.</Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>For example, the following raw markdown fragment shows how we can use parameterised values at the start of a generic, customisable “cribsheet” document.</Paragraph>
            <ProgramListing><Paragraph># Virtual Computing Environment Cribsheet ({{module_code}}, {{presentation_code}} Presentation)</Paragraph><Paragraph></Paragraph><Paragraph>## VCE Cribsheet</Paragraph><Paragraph></Paragraph><Paragraph>- Module code: {{module_code}}</Paragraph><Paragraph>- Presentation code: {{presentation_code}}</Paragraph></ProgramListing>

            <Heading>From markdown to OU-XML</Heading>
            <Paragraph>The range of MyST markdown elements that currently map on to OU-XML tags include:</Paragraph>
            <InternalSection id="headings">
                <Heading>Headings</Heading>
                <Paragraph>Use standard markdown heading levels (one or more <ComputerCode>#</ComputerCode> characters at start a line, followed by whistespace and then the header. The number of <ComputerCode>#</ComputerCode> characters specifes the heading level).</Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>Each included file represents a session and should start with a first level heading. Interior headings within the file (second level, third level, etc.) are associated with increasingly nested <ComputerCode>&lt;InternalSection&gt;</ComputerCode> tags, with the heading mapped to the <ComputerCode>&lt;Title&gt;</ComputerCode> tag at the start of the section.</Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>If the <ComputerCode>sphinx.config.myst_heading_anchors</ComputerCode> is set in the <ComputerCode>_config.yml</ComputerCode> file, identifiers are associated with each <ComputerCode>&lt;Session&gt;</ComputerCode> and <ComputerCode>&lt;InternalSection&gt;</ComputerCode> to the specified depth based on decasing the heading, removing punctuation and replace spaces with a <ComputerCode>-</ComputerCode>. Any generated section or subsection numbering is ignored.</Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>For example, <ComputerCode>## Second level heading</ComputerCode> would map to:</Paragraph>

                <Paragraph>The <ComputerCode>numfig</ComputerCode> parameter determines whether numeric references to figures may be generated; the <ComputerCode>numfig_format</ComputerCode> parameter specifies the format of the numeric reference text when a reference is generate; and the <ComputerCode>numfig_secnum_depth</ComputerCode> identifies the numbering level (incremental figure count across the item (<ComputerCode>0</ComputerCode>) or section number and figure number within section (<ComputerCode>1</ComputerCode>)).</Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>Links to figures can be described in the text via the unique reference, and either the caption text (<ComputerCode>{ref}`unique_image_reference`)</ComputerCode>) or, if enabled, the generated numeric reference (<ComputerCode>{numref}`g-other_file_in_item.md#unique_image_reference` </ComputerCode>) may be displayed.</Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>If the reference is to a figure in a separate file, the path to the source dilename should also be specified (for example, <ComputerCode>{numref}`unique_image_reference` </ComputerCode> or <ComputerCode>{ref}`other_file_in_item.md#unique_image_reference` </ComputerCode>).</Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>We can also use a <ComputerCode>{math}</ComputerCode> directive to define an equation block:</Paragraph>
        <ProgramListing><Paragraph>```{math}</Paragraph><Paragraph>:label: my-equation-identifier</Paragraph><Paragraph>w_{t+1} = (1 + r_{t+1})</Paragraph><Paragraph>s(w_t) + y_{t+1}</Paragraph><Paragraph>```</Paragraph></ProgramListing>
