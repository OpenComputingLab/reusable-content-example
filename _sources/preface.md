# Preface

Notes on a workflow for generating OU-XML from markdown and Jupyter notebook source documents using off-the-shelf Sphinx publishing tools with custom extensions. This allows content authored in markdown and Jupyter notebooks to be published via Structured Content publishing tools. Round-tripping between OU-XML and markdown is also explored allowing OU-XML to be converted back to markdown, ideally in a reversible way. An earlier case study of generating a customisable software guide for several OU modules from a set of common markdown source documents converted to OU-XML and then rendered to the VLE is also described.
