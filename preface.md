# Preface

Notes on a markdown based workflow for generating OU VLE content published from and intermediary OU-XML document format using off the shelf Sphinx publishing tools with a simple custom extension. A case study for generating a customisable, generic software guide for several OU modules from a set of common source documents and then rendering them to OU-XML is also described.
